# Bish Status Colors

This is a micro plugin for WordPress that decorates Posts, Pages, and some Custom Post Types according to their status when viewed in wp-admin. This isn't the only plugin that does this. This one does it simply and uses preset [Material Colors](https://www.materialui.co/colors) for the backgrounds and borders that are applied. There is no config. There are no options. There are only clearly decorated posts.

## Statuses

- **Sticky** (Lime)
- **Draft** (Amber)
- **Pending** Review (Light Green)
- **Scheduled** (Light Blue)
- **Password Protected** (Pink)
- **Private** (Red)
- Published posts are not altered

## Changes

If you'd like to alter the colors that are used, feel free to [fork a version of your own](https://github.com/bishless/bish-status-colors) and make it look the way you'd like.
